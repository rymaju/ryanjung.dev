This is a true guide to OOP (rather than a handbook of tips like Effective Java) and gives you a detailed systematic way of developing good object oriented code. The book is unfinished, but still the best introduction to good OOP I have found so far."

I found it surprisingly boring and long winded. Read the part on bounded context plus the glossary. The rest is nice, and the vocabulary is very useful, but anybody that claims they have a 'correct' way of modeling all data is fundamentally wrong (as time as shown)."
