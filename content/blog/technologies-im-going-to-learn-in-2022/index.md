Inspired by the Ben Awad video of the same name, I thought I would list out some of the things I plan to learn this year and why.

### 1. Haskell

I feel like I'm pretty decent at Racket. Programming in a functional style, regardless of whatever language you happen to be in, usually leads to clean code. Haskell has always eluded me every time I try to pick it up. I can't get how `Applicative`s and `Monoid`s and `Monad`s work. I have a surface level intuition but nothing more. Really grokking Haskell should give me some insight into "pure functional programming" and how it differs from the non-pure LISP I already know.

### 2. DOOM Emacs

I'm looking to explore other IDEs. I think its a mistake to stick with VSCode, even though Github Co-pilot has made my life so much easier. Exploring new tools is important. I tried picking up Emacs once last year but it didn't stick. I'm currently trying out a new setup in with DOOM (non-evil mode) and its working well so far. I'm excited to see if the programmable editor actually yields any significant performance boost.

### 3. Rust

I haven't touched systems level programming in a long time. I think Rust is a wonderful language with a great community. I've only heard good things about it and last time I touched it was over a year ago. I plan to follow the cookbook and maybe make a little LISP interpreter. I've also heard some different opinions on `actix-web`, so that may be worth taking a look at too.

### 4. Scala

Apparently Scala is Java, but good! I'm not convinced but I've never given it a fair shot besides a quick glance at the "Learn Scala in Y Minutes" doc.

### 5. One of { Prolog, Lean, Idris, Agda }

I find that logic programming hurt my head too much for me to spend a good enough amount of time to really understand any particular language. Nevertheless, I think I'll probably have a craving for it in a few months when I get tired of enterprise software development during my co-op.
